        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Mr. Lockhart - East High's Greatest Computer Science Teacher</h1>
        <p>My name is Scott Lockhart. I believe it is pronounced how it looks. I haven't heard too many people mispronounce my name. If you're a fan of Harry Potter, it's pronounced the same way as Professor Lockhart.<img src="professor_lockhart.png" width="100px"></p>

            While I'm at school, I enjoy teaching math and computer science. I'd probably say I enjoy computer science a little bit more, but I really like the math as well. I feel I learn new stuff every day from my students, and that make my work exciting. <img src="teaching.png" width="200px">

        <p>
            When I'm not at school these are the things I enjoy the most:
            <ul>
                <li>Family <img src="family.png" width="300px"></li>
                <li>Computer Coding</li>
                <li>Pokemon</li>
                <li>Watching soccer, especially Tottenham Hotspur</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not working on this class to earn a grade, I'm working on it to make it the best class possible for you. Most importantly I hope you learn a lot from it, but I also hope you enjoy it and convince your friends to take it too!

            My most favorite place I have been to would have to be Taiwan. I have included a picture of the city streets as well as a map below.<br>

            I've never been to Japan, but I would really love to go one day. I've also never been to a Premier League game, but I'd like to go see the Tottenham Hotspur play in England one day.<br>

            My favorite sport to watch is soccer, by far. I like to watch Tottenham Hotspur and LA Galaxy. My favorite board game to play is probably Monopoly.

            I'm already grown up, but I'll still answer. When I grow up, I'd like to be a teacher, and more importantly, a life-long learner.
